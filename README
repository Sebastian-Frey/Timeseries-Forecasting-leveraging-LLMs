This is the repository relating to the Mastersthesis on LLM-Augmented Time Series Forecasting for Car
Rental Cost per Click.
The *5 Methods* investigated in this thesis are:

• RQ1 What is the incremental value of “semantic competition” information (neighbour
CPC signals) and recency-sensitive weighting for improving CPC forecast performance
and how does that value differ across model families (Prophet, TimeGPT, Moirai)?
• RQ2: To what extent can Dynamic Time Warping–based neighbor selection improve
keyword-level CPC forecasting accuracy by integrating CPC signals from temporally
similar keywords, compared to models relying solely on autoregressive CPC histories?
• RQ3: Can the accuracy of keyword-level CPC forecasting be enhanced by modeling
localized competitive dynamics through the extraction of geographical intent?
• RQ4: Does incorporating an LLM-derived semantic keyword graph into spatio-temporal
graph neural networks improve CPC forecasting accuracy and robustness across multiple
forecast horizons, compared to both non-graph baselines and purely data-driven graph
learning approaches?
• RQ5 To what extent does explicitly modeling cross-domain competition through a fixed
binary graph improve the accuracy of CPC forecasting when using spatiotemporal graph
neural networks, compared to models that do not encode competitive structure?
